Setup
    [-] OpenFHE and python wrapper

Data loader program
    [-] Creater Data loader program to add plain data to DB
    [-] Add function to add encrypted data to DB
    [] Add function in data loader to add encrypted tables in 3 FHE schemes (CKKS, BGV, BVS)
    [] Use common keys to encrypt the data rather then generating on the fly

Data Search program
    [] Create Data Search program to search the revelant data from DB
    [] Calculate average Rent
    [] Add function to search encrypted data to DB
    [] Add function in data loader to add encrypted tables in 3 FHE schemes (CKKS, BGV, BVS)
    [] Use common keys to encrypt the data rather then generating on the fly

Query program
    [] Query front end to select data parameters
    [] Use common keys to encrypt data before sending to query program

Integration
    [] Integrate all programs to use common keys
    [] Data search results to be embedded in query program

Testing
    [] Various alogirthms performance (Search Time, Extend Partial, Setup time)
